# servo-control-using-potentiometers

In Tinkercad

1-Get a breadboard and an Arduino Uno
2-Connect the 5V pin in the Arduino with the positive pin in the breadboard
3-Connect the GND pin in the Arduino with the ground pin in the breadboard
4-Get 5 servo motors and connect them with the Arduino in pins D7 to D11
5-Connect the power terminals of the servo motors with the positive pins in the breadboard
6-Connect the ground terminals of the servo motors with the ground pins in the breadboard
7-Get 5 potentiometers and connect the wiper pins with the Arduino in pins A0 to A4
8-Connect terminal 1 of the potentiometers with the positive pins in the breadboard
9-Connect terminal 2 of the potentiometers with the ground pins in the breadboard
10-Get a battery and connect the positive side with the positive pin in the breadboard
11-Connect the negative side of the battery with the negative pin in the breadboard
12-Write the code and simulate the circuit
13-First define the variables for each servomotor 
14-Make the servo to start from 90 deg. 
15-Map the knob rotations of potentiometer such that it represents the different angles of the servo 
16-Turn the knobs of the potentiometer at various positions
17-Simulate the circuit and see that the servos rotate to different angles depending on the potentiometer
